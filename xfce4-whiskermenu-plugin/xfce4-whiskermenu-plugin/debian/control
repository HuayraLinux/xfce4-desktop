Description: Alternate menu plugin for the Xfce desktop environment
 Whisker Menu is an alternate application launcher for Xfce. When you open it
 you are shown a list of applications you have marked as favorites. You can
 browse through all of your installed applications by clicking on the category
 buttons on the side. Top level categories make browsing fast, and simple to
 switch between. Additionally, Whisker Menu keeps a list of the last ten
 applications that you've launched from it.
